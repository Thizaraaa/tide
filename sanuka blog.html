        <p>Sri Lanka has a coastline that extends over 1,700 km, with numerous coastal and marine ecosystems, which include a variety of economic activities such as fisheries and aquaculture, tourism and ports and shipping. Such economic activities provide livelihood for more than 300,000 people through fisheries and around another 350,000 people get their jobs in the coastal tourism industry. The interventions to harness the ‘blue economy’ or ‘ocean-based economy’ opportunities need to be optimised with a ‘do no harm’ approach to the water-based ecosystems.

            Every SDG needs engineers. How can engineers contribute to attain Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 – ‘Life below water’, which is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Oceans, seas and coastal areas create an integrated and vital component of the earth’s ecosystem and are critical to sustainable development. However, increased human activities greatly threaten and destroy these water bodies and livings. In this context, engineers contribute in developing many built environment facilities for promoting sustainable tourism, which will help to reduce the coastal pollution.</p>
        <p>Further to the current maritime activities such as fishing, shipping, and tourism, engineers can play a key role in exploring innovative energy generation methods from the sea, for which the research efforts to identify the most promising areas for optimum advantages are still at the primitive stages in Sri Lanka (Lokuliyana 2019). Sri Lanka being an island, adopting a ‘Blue Economy’ strategy is not optional but mandatory for Sri Lanka, which has many advantages (Senaratne 2017), while a number of challenges to strike a fair balance between the benefits for human and water livings.</p>
