            <h2>Marine diversity</h2>
            <p>Marine diversity, also known as marine biodiversity, refers to the vast variety of life forms found in the ocean, which covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface. This incredible diversity encompasses everything from microscopic plankton to the largest creatures on Earth, such as the blue whale. Marine biodiversity is essential for the health and stability of our planet's ecosystems, as well as for human well-being.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Genetic Diversity:</strong> This refers to the genetic variation within species, which allows populations to adapt to changing environmental conditions and helps ensure their survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Species Diversity:</strong> This is the variety of species within a particular region. The ocean is home to millions of species, many of which are still undiscovered. These include fish, mammals, birds, invertebrates, plants, and microorganisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Diversity:</strong> The ocean contains numerous ecosystems, each with its own unique community of organisms and environmental conditions. Examples include coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, deep-sea vents, and open ocean environments.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Ocean Ecosystems</h2>
            <p>Ocean ecosystems are diverse, dynamic environments that are home to a wide range of marine life. These ecosystems are defined by the unique physical and biological conditions of different parts of the ocean, from the sunlit surface waters to the dark depths of the abyssal plains. Each ecosystem plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the planet and supporting human livelihoods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coral Reefs:</strong> Often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. They are formed by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps, which build calcium carbonate skeletons. Coral reefs provide habitat for a vast array of marine species, protect coastlines from erosion, and support fishing and tourism industries.</li>
                <li><strong>Mangroves:</strong> These coastal forests are found in tropical and subtropical regions. Mangroves have specialized roots that allow them to thrive in salty, tidal waters. They serve as nurseries for many marine species, protect shorelines from storms and erosion, and filter pollutants from the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Seagrass Beds:</strong> Seagrass meadows are underwater grasslands found in shallow, coastal waters. They provide habitat and food for a variety of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, and sea turtles. Seagrasses also stabilize the seabed, improve water quality, and sequester carbon dioxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Ocean (Pelagic Zone):</strong> The open ocean is the largest and least explored ecosystem, covering more than half of the Earth's surface. It is divided into different zones based on depth, each with its own unique conditions and inhabitants. The pelagic zone is home to large marine animals like whales, dolphins, and tuna, as well as microscopic organisms like plankton.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Sea:</strong> The deep-sea ecosystem begins at depths of around 200 meters and extends to the ocean floor. It is characterized by high pressure, low temperatures, and complete darkness. Despite these harsh conditions, a surprising variety of life thrives here, including bioluminescent fish, giant squids, and tube worms around hydrothermal vents.</li>
                <li><strong>Estuaries:</strong> These are areas where freshwater from rivers and streams meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that provide critical habitat for many species of fish, birds, and invertebrates. They also act as natural filters, trapping pollutants and sediments from the land.</li>
                <li><strong>Polar Regions:</strong> The Arctic and Antarctic oceans are unique ecosystems with extreme cold temperatures and seasonal ice cover. These regions are home to specially adapted species like polar bears, penguins, seals, and krill, and play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate.</li>
